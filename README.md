# Sudoko
This project implements a simple Sudoku solver in C. The program reads a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle from the user, attempts to solve it using a backtracking algorithm, and then displays the solved puzzle. The solver works by trying to place numbers in empty cells while ensuring that each number is valid according to Sudoku rules.
